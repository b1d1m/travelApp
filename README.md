# Travel App for Mohammad Alduwairij

This is my final project in Udacity Fend course. I shoud make a travel app that uses the following APIs:

- [GeoNames]
- [Wheatherbit]
- [Pixabay]

To get the latitude and longitude of a speccific city from Geonames and use it in Weatherbit to get the weather for the destination city. finally to get an image of destination city and show it using Pixbay API.

I used bootstrap to style the site.

I hope you are intrestred to use the app :)

You could run the application as follows:

```sh
$ npm run build-dev
$ npm run build-prod
$ npm start
```
